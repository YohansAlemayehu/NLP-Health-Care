They were like major gas pains and I could only find comfort when lying on my side and staying very still. I didn't get much sleep the first night. I was awake just about every hour. I had a sense anxiety that something bad was going to happen. I have never suffered from anxiety or depression, and if this is what they feel like, I now sympathize with those who suffer from them!

I felt weak and zombie-like, and I still had the stomach pain, but was able to push through and function for most of the day.

After googling the side effects of Zithromax, late in the day, I ate some yogurt, drank some ginger ale and took an acidopholus supplement. Wow, I began to feel better within about an hour!

On the night that I began taking the medication, I had an episode where I felt like I was literally going crazy. These episodes continued in the evenings after taking the medication. Throughout the day I would have crying spells for no apparent reason which would include shortness of breath. I have had no appetite since I began taking the medication and I have to force myself to eat regular meals. I am not experiencing feelings of pleasure when taking part in activities that I normally enjoy. Loose stools and diarrhea occurred on days 4 and 5 of taking the medication. Everyone minimized the symptoms I was having because I was pregnant. They assumed I was overreacting to normal symptoms of pregnancy, despite the fact that I knew the way I was feeling was not a normal part of pregnancy. Unfortunately, I did not make the connection that it could be side effects of the medication until after I had taken the last dose. Once I found this website and read comments from others who have had similar experiences, I was convinced that everything I was experiencing was because of the medication.

Sure enough on day 6, I felt my throat closing up, extreme dizziness, lethargy & trouble putting words together. This occurred on a walk & it took all my energy to make my legs move forward. So scared I actually called someone & kept them on the phone in case I needed 911. It felt like I was having a stroke! The brain fog, vertigo, heart palpitations & lethargy continue on day 12! Sometimes it feels like narcolepsy--like I could pass out while sitting even. Strange otherworldly disconnection, drowsiness & swimming sensation. Exhausted after the least exertion. I called & spoke to 3 different doctors regarding these symptoms. I was given neurological tests (negative), told to get a chest X-ray (negative) & prescribed Dramamine for dizziness (ineffective). Not one doctor suggested it could be this dangerous drug, even though the FDA issued warnings earlier this year. This drug can kill! I will never take it again. Thanks to this forum I have hope but still no idea how long it will continue to vex me. If there is a class action lawsuit, count me in!!

I took 10 days of amoxicillin for strep throat, but it failed to clear the infection. My doctor immediately moved me to a 6 day, 500 MG treatment of Zithromax. This medicine did clear up the strep throat, as those symptoms vanished after the fourth day. Numerous side effects were experienced. The most alarming was that I completely lost my voice on day 4 of treatment and it was several days before I could speak at all. The dizziness and vertigo prevented my return to work since I could not stand up without falling over. The mental fog has been the most difficult side effect to overcome. I have not had mood swings or unusual thoughts as other people have mentioned, but I have had trouble forming complete thoughts or even remembering simple things since around day 3 on Zithromax. The side effects do fade a little each day, but it seems to take roughly a month to get back to normal after the medicine is done. I would take the medicine again simply because it cleared the strep throat that other antibiotics could not, but patients should definitely beware the numerous side effects.",F,36,6 days500 MG 1X day,9/30/2013

In 2009, after having taken 4 or 5 name brand Z-Packs in the past with no problems, I was given a generic script, and made a post in this forum about side-effects I'll remember for the rest of my life. The insomnia alone lasted for 6 months, and weird emotions with which I'd never had problems in the past: Dread, Fear, Depersonalization were horrific. My heart would suddenly race at any sudden sound. A couple of people on this forum helped me get through it.","You would think that I would never take the drug again, but was talked into ""re-challenging"" my system with name-brand Zithromax by a friend / physician I've known for 25 years, as I was running out of treatment options.
I purchased the name-brand Z-Pack ($90) and after saying a prayer, started. To my great relief, none of the life-changing symptoms that I experienced last time occurred, other than my heart lightly pounding for brief periods. I almost can't believe that I tried to take it again- I swore that after the hell I went through there would be no way.

Also, the first day you have to take two of the pills, and after that, I felt like death warmed over. I also felt a scary sense of panic and tingling in my arms! These subsided within the hour as I relaxed and drank a lot of water. Tummy aches, too, but I learned quickly to eat a BIG breakfast and then take the Z-pack pill. That wasn't easy because of the 3rd side effect: loss of appetite! That got better as the days went on. Also, a feeling of being ""out of it,"" and some depression. I prayed a lot while taking this: Lord, use it to heal me!","I went to bed one night, after a very stressful couple of days, with a tickle at the back of my throat. Next morning, I began coughing up green phlegm and felt fatigue and detached from reality. I also had yellow pus in one eye! My nurse practitioner prescribed the Z-pack. Soon after taking my first dose, I could feel the ""battle"" going on in my bronchi and chest as the days went on, and now, on day 5 feel much improved. Thank GOD I didn't have the bad side effects consistently. It was rough, but I'm thankful that the pills helped me. Don't forget to take the probiotics and force yourself to eat a good, solid breakfast before you take the pill!

It has been 5 days since my first dose and I am now feeling disoriented and having difficulty concentrating. I still feel very dizzy at times and feel like I amg going to pass out. I feel restless when I am trying to sleep. I also am having muscle weakness and loss of appetite. I can hardly function or do minimal tasks. I am wondering if anyone has had similar cognitive effects and how long they lasted. I had a similar experience with a quinilone antibiotic and my problems lasted over a year so I am very concerned about the potential long term effects of this antibiotic. Feel free to send me an email if you have had a long term cognitive effect from this medication. Also, I still have the tooth and sinus infection.",F,40,2 days250 1X day,1/24/2013Email

That would explain all of your feelings including dread. This is a very strong antibiotic and yes there are side effects. you were prescribed this because of the severity of you illness. If you do not react well to tell your Doctor but do not tell people to use it. It is highly effective and has worked very well for me. Yes, I experienced the upset stomach and pains.

3,bronchitis poss pneumonia,"RInging in the ear which stopped after first dose. Skin crawling feeling being ill or maybe poisoned? which passed within 4 hours of each dose. headache behind right eye and on top of head, extreme nausea.","took for 4 days. I took for bronchitis possible pneumonia. HEADACHE started 3 days in and I have been treating with motrin and chewing baby aspirin (x2) between doses. I felt awful after each dose but I had been sick for A MONTH. First dose I had ringing in the ears and it scared me. I was afraid of a severe allergic reaction so I took benadryl and waited for the doctor to call me back which took a while and ringing diminished. He said to wait and see if it occurred after the 2nd dose. It did not so I continued taking the pills but stopped after 4days as I felt ill after each dose, skin crawling icky feeling I can't describe. The headache came the 3rd day but I thought it was from being sick, took some ibuprofen and then noticed my right eye felt funny. I couldn't concentrate very well so I just rode it out and kept chewing the baby aspirin between taking ibuprofen. I can't sleep and I have this headache. I can't find anything about WHAT causes it which would make it easier to deal with! I have takene this before with no problem and I SERIOUSLY believe it is because it is the generic. Yes they are prob identical in chemical compound but if two people make the same box cake one can be terrible and the other great. Maybe the quality of HOW it is made makes the difference.

5,Pharyngitis,At first no side effects. About 3 or 4 days into the antibiotic I had intense watery diarrhea at least 2 or 3 times a day. Then it started to decrease and stop about the 5th or 6th day of taking it. A day of diarrhea after stopping it. Increased appetite and some minor itching occasionally. Minor agitation/depression that could be contributed to how i was feeling before taking the medication due to being sick. Other than that; not a real big deal with this medication for me.,This med worked quickly. After taking the initial dose of 500mg i woke up feeling 75% better. Gradually about 2nd or 3rd day I was feeling a lot better just as the doctor said I would. 2 days after stopping it im feeling good over all. Just a minor earache that the doctors cannot contribute to anything. Lastly; DO NOT let others horror stories scare you when taking THIS medication. I was almost not going to take it due to what I was reading but I figured I could wait it out and be miserable or just take it and see if I would feel better in a couple days like the doctor said. Well I did. Just be aware of wheezing or shortness of breath and STOP immediately and go to the Emergency Room. But give the medication a try. You dont know if its going to work or not until you try.

According to Wikipedia (not the most reliable source, but depends on their sources) a single dose of Azithro has a half life of only 12 hours, which means it should be out of my system tonight. The 60+ hour half life (meaning it stays in your system a total of 120+ hours) occurs after repeated doses.
The version I am taking is Teva. However, since Israel is our ally, I strongly doubt they are trying to engage in chemical or bio warfare with us through pharmaceuticals.
The one who said that most people here who experience severe side effects seems to have underlying issues has a point. I know I do, including anxiety disorder, OCD and various forms of chronic illness. It doesn't mean that I or anyone else is a nutcase, only that we may be more prone to certain adverse reactions.
Most post on these sites only when they experience a bad reaction. This can give the impression that such reactions are common, when in reality the vast majority don't experience them.

I started with the 250mg 5 day course, which helped and the only side effect was a metal taste in my mouth. Then a week later, the bronchitis came back with a vengeance (and yes, I finished my first course completely), so the doc gave me the 3 day course in 500 mg. Day one, everything was fine. Day two, within about 3 hours of taking, i began having the worst stomach cramps ever.. my stomach making all sorts of not ladylike noises. That was immediately followed by very severe vomiting and diarrhea which i am still suffering from. It's totally awful. My bronchitis symptoms are now pretty much gone, so I am seriously considering not taking the last pill. The cure is almost worse than the ailment!

Didn't have insurance, so I dragged my feet when it came to seeing a doctor. The cough got worse so I saw one, and he prescibed me a z pak. On the first two days, I experienced mild diarrhea and anxiousness. Reading the reviews on this site and others probably added to the anxiousness. The first night's sleep was very vivid and weird. I think that's because I took two pills that day. By day 3, I started feeling much better, and started coughing up all the mucus that was making me cough. I vomited in the morning a few times, but it wasn't substantial and mostly had to do with my coughing.
I highly recommend taking a pro biotic 2 hours after taking a z pak pill, because the antibiotic gets rid of the good bacteria you need to digest things properly. It could help prevent stomach pains and diarrhea. Also, eat yogurt regularly. Especially AFTER you're done with the z pak cycle, to help get your digestive system back to normal. At least for the first week after your cycle.
I also highly suggest chamomile tea for the anxiety, it helped me. Good luck to those taking the medicine, it was definitely frustrating to get used to but I felt much better after.",M,23,5 days250 mg 1X day,5/17/2010

My advice is over the year following taking this stuff, if you feel like you are getting the stomach flu and have diarrhea (i did not vomit), do not wait to see if it runs it course. Go directly to the doctor and get a stool sample done to check for C Diff. Demand the test so you can start therapy.

My doctor sent me to a hospital in Houston for a blood test and one of the negative results indicated that 20 percent of my white blood cells had been destroyed by the zithromax. It took six months for my white blood cell count to return to normal. I can't even recall if my viral infection cleared up as a result of the zithromax, because I was in such horrible agony after taking the zithromax that I forgot about my viral infection.

Common sense would tell anyone to take a couple of doses and see how you personally react to this antibiotic. I think people forget the fact that this antibiotic is basically a fungus, and if you eat fungus of course it may cause a little stomach upset and ringing in the ears, but I personally am willing to let this strain of bacteria overtake and destroy the bacteria that causes my terrible sinus, ear, and bronchial infections (sometimes all at once!!).

Dose 1 (Huge panic attack, slight heart racing), D2 (stomach cramps, gas, bloating), D3 I ate yogurt and it seemed to help the stomach cramping alittle ( gas, slight nausea), and D4 (stomach cramps, gas, bloating, serious heart racing and I kept jumping up out of my sleep.) I had two more days to take the meds but stopped. It was just plain awful and I was scared the entire time I was taking the medicine. I could go on and on about this med but to cut this short..... It really, truly works but not without a price. My URI cleared up in the 4 days I took the meds, I felt much better but I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MEDICATION! One more thing....it has been nearly two weeks since I stopped taking the meds and I have begin to breakout in a daily itchy rash that is driving me crazy!",F,44,4 days,12/28/2009Email
2,Bronchitis,"Very, very unpleasant stomache pains. The night after taking the first dose, I was woken several times (strangely enough, almost exactly three hours between each occasion) by severe stomache pain. Eating helped for the next few hours. I called my doctor the next morning and he advised me to stop taking it. More than 24 hours later, I am still experiencing this pain. It's keeping me awake.
Strange, considering I took the same medication for strep this past summer, with no side effects albeit a rather odeous stench whenever I urinated, and to great avail as far as curing my symptoms of strep.
On the plus side, it relieved my even-more-unpleasant Bronchitis symptoms, within hours.","No prior experience with upset stomache after taking medication. No regular issues with upset stomach/ indigestion/any of the other symptoms that pepto bismol claims to remedy.

Although it helps every single time. YOU yourself, need to decide if your going to take it or not. do you really think a lot of people will come here and say it worked great? of course not! this place is really gonna scare people out of taking medicine they need.

I had reservations about it but I did some research and found that generic drugs have different effects on the body. Generic drugs may have the same active ingredients, but are not time released or absorbed in the blood stream the same way as the name brand. There are also different buffer ingredients and they are not tested the same. There is an artcle on people's pharmacy.com that you should read, they also have over 1200 stories of patients that have had horror stories about generic drugs.

My muscles feel as if I had an extreme work out and I feel weak overall. The symptoms started the second day with complete loss of sense of taste and smell (which I attributed to the sinus infection at first, but it was so extreme, I'm wondering if it wasn't the generic Z-pack. After the fifth day of taking it, I developed weird heart racing and fluttering which comes and goes. That's also when these weakness spells developed.
It's now the 10th day after taking it, and I'm still feeling crappy (weak, heart racing and / or weird sensations in the heart). It's pretty scary and at first I thought I was having a heart attack. This medication should be much better screened. I think it shouldn't be given out willy nilly.

However, these past two times I used it, the cramps are well into the 3rd day and I don't have a solid stool until I am off it a few days.

Ever since she has had severe stomach issues. She has always been a healthy child with NO stomach problems what so ever until this medication was given. We have been in and out of docotr's offices, pediatric GI specialists, and hospital visits for her severe stomach pains tha thave lasted hours for the past 5 years!!!.

Instead she has been diagnosed with such things as Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Acid Reflux Disease (GERD), to all in her head. She too has developed lactose intolerances and severe sensitivity too anything acidic which we had to find out on our own. Now she must take Nexium and any other type of antacid to help her relieve her pain. Not the way an 11 year old child should have to live their life.

I called a number of behavioral health professionals after a sleepless night with 5 hours of crying and wild graphic dreams. I could barely speak on the phone from crying. I looked online for causes of crying uncontrollably since I had no rational reason or sadness and found many people have experienced this same effect from the drug. I would not have connected the two and might have gone into serious psychiatric counseling for no reason. I called my doctor and said I was taking myself off because of the side effects. He didn't think the drug was the problem. He asked me if I had recently broken up with a boyfriend. No. So ridiculous. I told him I didn't get the connection until I looked up my symptoms on the internet. I went down the list of symptoms and even added I had experienced vivid dreams and paranoia while on larium, which paled in comparison. While he knew about the side effects of Larium, he still did not think these effects were related to z-pack- I took the generic azithromycin- and said I should get immediate help from a psychiatrist. He asked if I had recently lost a job or experienced the loss of a loved one.

It also reacted with my Acid reflex medicine. Very bad reaction when given pepcid in the hospital. I started to feel that I wasn't myself. I was someone else and I wanted OUT. I had to be sedated with an even worse medication. My parents kept trying to tell the doctors that I had a bad reaction to the Zpak along with my acid reflex medicines, and then the pepcid, but the doctors refused to admit or agree with them. Finally all medications were stopped and I was able to go home from the hospital. The doctors are making me see a phyciatrist before going back to work. No doctor will admit the effects that I experienced were caused by the Zpak interacting with my acid reflex medicine or just the effects of the Zpak. After reading the side effects here, I know now that they are all in bed with the drug companies and they don't really care about their patients. Just wait until something like this happens to one of their children or themselves. I am recovering but still have some anxiety and hope that it will leave me soon. I also hope that I do not loose my job over this. Prayers helped me get through this, and I thank God that he stood by me throughout this ordeal.

Including a Rhuemetologist, as he was now 5 with severe leg pains and non of them knew the cause was the Prevacid. There were a ton of other side effects that he obtained, the root was the Zithromax and the secondary was the side effects from the Prevacid.

That being said pneumonia is just one of those long, dragging, miserable illnesses that just goes on forever and ever. Weeks and weeks go by and it just takes forever to go away.

Everything has a price. For me, it is upsetting other GI problems I have and it is painful at times. It is even making breathing worse at times because my stomach is pressing up against my diaphragm due to bloating and this is making the breathing harder.

Luckily I work from home...,"Getting into months two now -- SIDE EFFECTS: Anxiety, Fever Dreams, Paranoia, Depression, Intestinal pain, Distorted Vision, Dizziness, Fatigue, Exaustion, Break out on forehead (where I've never broken out before!), joint and muscle aches, and a kind of fungal infection on my hands, making them red, blotchy and scaly (again, I've never had any skin problems in my life!). FOr anyone with the hand issue, Hydrocoritisone helps. The break out goes away with lots of working out and sweating. Drink LOTS and LOTS of water every day. My symptoms have only improved through exercise and H20...

I MAY have experienced auditory hallucinations in the middle of the night, while in a semi-dreaming state. I don't do well on drugs at all, so I'm surprised and somewhat ashamed that I took to this drug like a duck to water. I did have a sudden craving for organic yogurt so that may have been my saving grace, because I always pay attention to and indulge in food cravings.","I felt much better within a day. :-)

I couldn't go to work because it was so bad. Severe lower left back pain, starting on day 1 and getting worse as the day progressed; waking up each day after that, the pain was worse than the day before. I could not sit down anywhere comfortably, walking hurt, I would get severe sharp pains as well as constant pain. Severe abdominal cramps on day 3, which was the last day I took this. When walking, I had to hold my stomach because the pain was so bad. For a continuous 30 minutes on day 3, my stomach made the loudest noises I've ever had. On day 3, my face took on a reddish tint.

However, I consider myself fortunate to have had a positive experience with the medication. While I did have some nausea, I realize that as with road construction, sometimes things have to get a little more bumpy before they get a lot smoother. So I dealt with the nausea. By Day 3, I was no longer showing symptoms of the bronchitis. I was no longer coughing up blood, coughing up phlegm all day and all night. It really ""dried me up"".

I have never experienced a reaction to any drug, so this (pardon the use of the term) freaked me out.","Called my doctor, who indicated that they had never heard of anyone really having a reaction.

Ive never had these symptoms before i landed myself a medical profesional in the ER scared as crap feelings of doom.

Finished my last dose 2 days ago and im just waiting for it to leave my system. It will take time it continues to work days 6 through 10 so i got 3 more days to freakin go.

2,Sinus Infection,"upset stomach, loose stools, severe anxiety, metallic taste in mouth",I've taken zpack before but I believe this is the first time I have had the generic (azithromycin) and it is also the first time I have experienced these side effects. The anxiety is very bad. It didn't start until after my last dose which is why I didn't even relate it to the drug until reading these posts. Each pill has a half life of 68 hours so I'm hoping I feel better in a few more days. I have been on prozac for nearly 15 years for anxiety so I know what it feels like and I am feeling very much like I did before I started taking prozac. How can the generic be so different than the regular zpack. I won't take the generic again. I'll pay full price for zpack out of my pocket if I have to. I will say it did clear up my sinus infection promptly though.,F,39,5 days,1/21/2009

My heart rate slowed down within 5 minutes - and my whole body was shaking. Now I was cold, clammy, light headed and very weak - but at least I didn't feel disoriented anymore. Just when I thought the nightmare was over... on came the most terrifying stomach pains!!! These sharp burning pains lasted about 30 minutes - the longest 30 minutes in my life! I lay in bed for three hours until the worst of side effects went away. Once I could get my bearings I grabbed the z pack and flushed it! I thought to myself 1% my arse...yeah I read the info that comes with it - adverse side effects and testing states this happens to only 1% of people.

I also had symptoms of a upper respiratory infection. I was put on the Z-Pak just in case. Monday's labs were negative and I feel miserable with abdominal cramps and slight nausea and no appetite. I stopped the medication after day-3 due to the discomfort and negative labs. To be fair, I believe the medication did help with the respiratory symptoms. However, the side effects, this time, are too much. I have become a victim of the cure and, to me, it's not worth it this time. I don't think I will try this product again, The first time it worked well and this time it helped some. It is a mixed bag of results so you have to try it yourself, be your own judge.

I never would have thought in a million years that an antibiotic would have given me such extreme mental side effects. I was given Z-Pak after a tooth extraction as I had a bad (and similar) reaction to Clydamycin.
I was on the 250 MG X 3 days. After the first day I started to suffer from depersonalization. Depersonalization, in my opinion, is the worst thing that can happen to anyone. Essentially I felt like I was dead, in limbo. Nothing mattered. I questioned reality. I felt like a ghost. It was so bad that I had to break out the Bible.

However, the rash is a sign of an allergic reaction and my doctor banned it for future use on me.","Zithromax is a powerful medicine and works well. Care should be taken to monitor your body's reaction to it. You should expect SOMETHING to happen, like the loose stool, but if unusual stuff crops up, notify your doc as soon as possible.

I thought I'd probably pulled a muscle working out since I had just started a new workout routine. I went to the doctor the next day who prescribed muscle relaxants and prescription naprozen for pain and to apply heat compress to the site. He also prescribed z-pak (i.e. zithromax) for potential ear, throat or sinus injection as I had been coughing up sputum and had congestion. The next day I had some mild pink rash running along my right side. The following day the rash was red and forming small blisters and the p","Sure enough I was later diagnosed with shingles. I believe the cold medication might have been masking the onset of shingles, and that the zithromax, probably along with the cold, may have weakened my immune system bringing about an outbreak of shingles after only two does of zithromax.

I like this verses amoxicillan because amox upsets my stomach horribly and zithromax doesn't really have any side effects for me. It depends on the person. Every persons body chemistry is different. I am also on birth control, so I don't have to worry about yeast infections as with zithromax like I would with other antibiotics. Zithromax works great and I will definitely use it again.

They checked my blood and heart and said I looked fine so there was no allergic reaction and tried to send me home. Obviously doctors are not really well informed about this drug. After the drug finally wore off I returned to normal and everything was fine for about 1 month. Then suddenly one day I had a full blown panic attack that brought all the horrible feelings back.

I eventually got very, very tired and thought it was the Lyme- it turned out to be the side effect of the zithromax and went away three days after I stopped.

This is the second time this has happened to me after taking zithromax. Two years ago the anxiety lasted for three months and the stomach problems resulted in being perscribed previcid and lasting 9 months off and on. Once again, I consulted my Dr. and a pharmasist, and once again I was treated as if there is no way this could happen. So I researched this on the internet (including this site) and came up with a long shot. ACTIVIA! Two days after completing the zpack I started consuming Activia in large qtys (10+ a day). I had instant results. Truth be told it was the only thing I had eaten in 3 days (any food / water/ drink would start my stomach and anxiety problems).

Welcome to the ""practice"" of medicine, its not called the ""perfection"" of medicine. I had sinus surgery, which is extremely painful, and here is my two cents worth. Trust me when I say, if you have a bad sinus infection CRUSH it. When you get a sinus infection your sinuses are swollen and the longer they stay swollen the more difficult it is for your body to get them healed. The more times you are sick with an infection or if they last long then your sinuses have more and more trouble getting back to normal and this can lead to conditions that warrant surgery.

Three days later, I felt itchy all over. I also broke out in hives, and welts would appear all over my body. Out with the pills and onto Benadryl.

1,broncitis,Chronic outbreaks of shingles and herpes,"Four of my family members have suffered from severe side effects, which seem to involve the breakdown of the bodyÃ¯Â¿Â½s immune system to fight off nerve related viral diseases, such as shingles, and herpes. All of us had been prescribed zithromax (z-pack) to fight off bronchitis, strep, or sinus infections, which the drug was somewhat successful in resolving, but not always; however, about a week or so after completing the dosage of five days, we began to suffer severe oral herpes outbreaks. In three of the cases, there were severely painful outbreaks of shingles.
My doctor no longer prescribes it mostly as a result to similar complaints like those stated on this board.
For our problems, the doctors only seem to want to treat the symptoms of herpes and shingles, and have not made this connection as being a side-effect of zithromax (z-pack) and a breakdown in the immune system. We were prescribed Zoverax, which was worthless, then switched to Valtrex, which had some effect, but only short-term relief. It was not until we received another anti-biotic that our immune systems stabilized against outbreaks of herpes and shingles. This makes no sense and most doctors argue to no end that antibiotics do not help with these viral diseases such in the control of herpes and shingles; but in our case it did.
The three antibiotics that seem to provide some relief to the side effects of zithromax (z-pack) were Bactrim DS, PCE, and Biaxon. Never again will I take Z-pack.",M,37,5 days,07/01/2005

I'm only on day 2 with the meds so I hope this goes away soon. Pepto-bismol does nothing to help the cramps, it only makes your poo black.

I was prescribed Zithromax after asking for Biaxin 500mg. I know for a fact that Biaxin will get me well but this doctor insisted that I use the Z-pack. It's a 5 day treatment with 2 pills the first day. I also took a shot of cortisone and something else. Today is my second day and I don't feel any better than yesterday. I am still coughing horribly. But, at least the phlegm is breaking up and coming out. I guess that means it's working. I still don't see how a 5 day treament of 250mg Zithromax is going to make me better when I am used to taking Biaxin 500mg for Bronchitis. I rated this medecine a 2 because I don't see any change in my condition. If I were on my last day taking the Z-pack and still felt like this, I would have rated it a 1.",F,30,2 days,1/23/2005

I had been on other meds with no luck and after 4 months zithromax did it. I am wary of ever taking it again though due to the side effects.
